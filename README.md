# Create progenitors

Inlists and scripts used for calculating a large grid of subdwarf B stars with the MESA code. The project utilizes progenitor grid calculated with [create_progenitors](https://github.com/cespenar/create_progenitors), requires [MesaScript](https://github.com/wmwolf/MesaScript), and is meant to be run on the BEM cluster provided by [WCSS](www.wcss.pl).
